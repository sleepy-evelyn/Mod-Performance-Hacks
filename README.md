## Configuration options

- 🚂💥 **Train collisions** - Disable collisions between trains. Massively improves performance on modded servers.

- ⏱️ **Increase Max ETA Time** - Increase the estimated time of arrival displayed for Trains from 10 > 60 minutes.

- 🚄💨 **Train Motion Tweaks** - Configurable Top Speed & Acceleration for individual trains which can be changed within a Stations GUI.

- 🚰 **Cache unfillable items** - Introduces a cache for items that can't be used in Spout filling recipes. Provides better performance at scale especially if Create is combined with other mods like AE2.


## Train disassembly lock
You can now prevent other players or groups from disassembling a train.

- 🔧 **Unique to each train** - A disassembly lock is unique to each train and can be set whilst a train is at a station

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **OPAC support** - Supports Open Parties & Claims. Includes a lock setting which only allows members of the same party to disassemble your train.

- ⚠️ **Staff bypasss option** - Staff members with `/op` and groups with permission node `create_configured.bypass_train_disassembly` can bypass any lock.

- 🛡️ **SnR & CC:Tweaked integration** - Provides computers and deployers holding a wrench with the context required to disassemble a train safely, respecting the disassembly lock.

## Q&A

<details>
<summary>☑️ Changing config options</summary>
<br>  
<b>All features are enabled by default on dedicated servers.</b> You can disable any feature if desired; note that some options are always disabled in singleplayer. <br/><br/><b>A server must be restarted for configuration changes to take effect.</b>

<summary>⚠️ CC:Tweaked (Computercraft) Disassembly Warning</summary> 
Create Configured version <code>1.2.2+</code> has support for CC:Tweaked. Only Create version <code>6.0.10+</code> will work as there is a bug that causes a crash on disassembly on older versions.
